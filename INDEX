How is PHP used in HTML?
PHP is often used to build dynamic web pages. A dynamic web page is one where each visitor to the website gets a customized page that van look different than how the site looks to another visitor. This is in contrast to static web pages which provide the same content to each visitor.
When the website is delivered from the back-end to the front-end, the PHP content is executed and added to the HTML document.
