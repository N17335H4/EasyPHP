MANIPULATION
SELECT * FROM x...x //fetches all the data present in x...x
A relational database is a database that organizes information into one or more tables.
Batabases can be non-relational, called as NoSQL databases. With relational, we structure tables by the type of relations, but NoSQL keeps all the information in one place, in the form of key-values or documents.
CREATE TABLE is a clause. Clauses perform specific tasks in SQL. By convention, clauses are written in capital letters. Clauses can also be referred to as commands.
//CREATE: error occurs without modifying or creating table, if given an already existing name.
//INSERT: more than one values can be inserted into the table at a time.
//ALTER: to add a column to the table. but we cannot specify the position to add it, it gets added at the end.
NULL is a special value in SQL that represents missing or unknown data. 
LIMIT should be added under the condition, if only specific number of rows are to e deleted.
Constraints: 
PRIMARY KEY columns can be used to uniquely identify the row. Attempts to insert a row with an identical value to a row already in the table will result in a constraint violation which will not allow you to insert the new row.
UNIQUE columns have a different value for every row. This is similar to PRIMARY KEY except a table can have many different UNIQUE columns.
NOT NULL columns must have a value. Attempts to insert a row without a value for a NOT NULL column will result in a constraint violation and the new row will not be inserted.
DEFAULT columns take an additional argument that will be the assumed value for an inserted row if the new row does not specify a value for that column.
-- ANALYzE (obtain the statistics about the table), DROPTABLE (completely delete a table from database)
QUERY
Querying is to retrieve info from database. Queries allow us to communicate with the database by asking questions and having the result set return data relevant to the question.
//AS to rename a column, multiple renames can take place at a time.
DISTINCT is used to return unique values in the output. It filters out all duplicate values in the specified column(s). //if we use multiple arguments, then we may see same values printed in each coulmn, but combinedly it prints unigue set of columns.
//LIKE can be used for numericals or text. _ used for one character missing and % for many. But it is not case sensitive. if required to search % or _ then \- escape is used.
BETWEEN: for numbers - [ ], for alaphabets - [ )
ORDER BY: //after where if present// desc or asc (by default).
//In the result, you have to scroll right because the column name is very long. To shorten it, we can rename the column to ‘Review’ using AS:
don't forfet comma after select argumets while using case
AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
count(), sum(), min(), max(), avg(), round(col, no. of decimal places req) (can use constraints before arguments too)
**GROUP BY //you can GROUP BY a column that was not included in the SELECT statement also.
/*SELECT ROUND(imdb_rating),
   COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY ROUND(imdb_rating)
ORDER BY ROUND(imdb_rating);
=
SELECT ROUND(imdb_rating),
   COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1; //where 1 is col1 of select */ //no order followed while referring columns with no.s.
HAVING: imagine that we want to see how many movies of different genres were produced each year, but we only care about years and genres with at least 10 movies. 
We can’t use WHERE here because we don’t want to filter the rows; we want to filter groups.
SELECT year,
   genre,
   COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY 1, 2
HAVING COUNT(name) > 10;
MULTIPLE TABLES
Combining tables by JOIN. if needed WHERE, then it comes after ON. //NULL values do not match while joining. //maintain order of tables for order of columns in result
LEFT JOIN: prints the remained ones of table1 with null in other columns.
primary keys: can't be null, each value must be unique and a table can't have more than one primary key column.
foreign key: primary key of other table
CROSS JOIN: n1 * n2 rows //no ON and it can performed over multiple tables * * * ...
UNION: iff same columns in same order in both // duplicates are excluded
WITH: //can be used with more than one loop // *do not include ; inside parenthesis
